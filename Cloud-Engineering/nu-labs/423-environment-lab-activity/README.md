# Environment and Project Management

We will cover several topics important for managing projects and environments. We have already interacted with many of these concepts and tools, but will cover them in more depth during this workshop.

We will cover the following:

- [Python Virtual Environments](./virtual_environments/README.md)
- [Cookiecutter Tool for Project Templating](./cookiecutter/README.md)
- [Creating a Python Package](./packaging/README.md)
